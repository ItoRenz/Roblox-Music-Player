## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Adding Your Own Songs

Modify the `musicList` table in the script:

```lua
local musicList = {
    {id = "rbxassetid://YOUR_AUDIO_ID", title = "Your Song Title"},
    {id = "rbxassetid://YOUR_AUDIO_ID", title = "Another Song"},
    -- Add more songs here
}
```

### Changing Default Settings

Edit the `state` table:

```lua
local state = {
    currentIndex = 1,      -- Starting song index
    isPlaying = false,     -- Auto-play on join
    loopMode = "all",      -- Default loop mode: "off", "all", or "one"
    volume = 2,            -- Default volume (0-10)
}
```

### UI Positioning

Adjust button positions in the UI setup section:

```lua
-- For PC
Position = UDim2.new(0.5, -190, 0, 12)

-- For Mobile
Position = UDim2.new(0.5, -15, 0, 12)
```

## üîß Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Service-Based**: Uses Roblox services (Players, SoundService, UserInputService, RunService)
- **State Management**: Centralized state object with persistent storage via `_G`
- **Event-Driven**: Connects to player events for seamless experience
- **Mobile Detection**: Automatically detects device type and adjusts UI

### Persistent Storage

The player saves the following data:
- Current song index
- Playing/stopped state
- Loop mode preference
- Volume level
- Playback time position

Data is stored in `_G.MusicPlayerData` and persists across:
- Character respawns
- Server hops (in same session)
- UI toggles

### Performance Optimizations

- **Heartbeat-based updates**: Smooth progress bar animation
- **Auto-save interval**: Saves state every 5 seconds during playback
- **Efficient rendering**: Mobile-optimized UI elements
- **Error handling**: Graceful failure with automatic song skip

---

## üìã Requirements

- Roblox Studio (any recent version)
- LocalScript execution environment
- Audio assets uploaded to Roblox

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Music Won't Play

1. **Check Audio IDs**: Ensure all `rbxassetid://` URLs are valid
2. **Verify Permissions**: Make sure audio assets are public or you own them
3. **Console Errors**: Check Output window for error messages

### UI Not Showing

1. **Script Location**: Confirm script is in `StarterGui > ScreenGui`
2. **ResetOnSpawn**: Ensure ScreenGui's `ResetOnSpawn` is set to `false`
3. **Click MUSIC Button**: The UI is hidden by default

### Music Stops After Death

This is intentional behavior if music wasn't playing before death. The player preserves your playback state.

### Volume Too Loud/Quiet

- Adjust volume using the input box (0-10 range)
- Internal multiplier: `actualVolume = inputValue * 0.25`
- Maximum Roblox volume is 10, but player caps at 2.5 actual volume
